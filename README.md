# Undergraduate-Studies

Work from classes I took during Undergraduate at University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I began compiling this repository after I graduated so numerous classes are missing. 

The courses included are:

# Mathematical Modeling
All coding portions homework from Math 4428 Spring 2018 with Joseph Feneuil. I used the Julia language for the coding.

# Senior Project
A short paper of Potential Flow around a disc from Spring 2018 completed with advisor Matthias Maier.

# Numerical Analysis
Some work from Math 5485 Fall 2017 with Matthias Maier, unfortanately I lost most of the Julia code from this course
