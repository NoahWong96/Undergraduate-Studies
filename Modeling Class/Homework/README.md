This files includes homework from  Math 4428 Mathematical Modeling I took in Spring 2018, taught by Joseph Feneuil, at the University of Minnesota Twin Citites. I'm currently adapting the homework files into more readable code that includes comments on the work and in the code and revelant excerpts from the textbook. The coding files I originally turned in are pretty sparse on comments since the grader knew the problems and they include some code the professor gave us that didn't need explaination. So it's a long process of converting it into readable code that an outsider could read through and understand what I'm doing. I will keep this file updated with the progress I made.


---- Progess ----
I've finished adapting HW3, HW4, HW5 and HW6 into readable code so If you've looking for good examples of my work check those out first. I would reccomend looking at Homework 4 as the problems are a bit more engaging and in depth than the others.


---- Summaries ----
Homework 3- includes using one dimensional and two dimensional Newton's method to optimizing a simple profit equation as well as performing a sensitivity analysis on a coefficient in our profit equation.

Homework 4- includes two problems
         1.) Presents an optimization problem of finding the best location in a city for a police station by the average response time at each location. Requires plotting a contour plot to hone in on a 2x2 block of the city with which we use the Random Search               Method to find the optimal location of the station. Also includes a sensitivity analysis on how the number of calls in a                   certain block affects the optimal location of the station.
         2.) Problem 2 has a two variable profit equation that must be optimized with 2D Newton's method and includes numerous sensitivity analysis's .
               
Homework 5- includes one problem, a discrete modeling example of docking a spacecraft with an iterative process of adjusting the acceleration. 

Homework 6- one problem, population model of whales, given an equation that models the growth of two whale populations I create a fucntion that simulates the whale populations over time.
