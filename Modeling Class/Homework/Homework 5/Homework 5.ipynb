    "\n",
    "**Example 4.3**. Astronauts in training are required to practice a docking maneuver under manual control. As a part of this maneuver, it is required to bring an orbiting spacecraft to rest relative to another orbiting craft. The hand controls provide for variable acceleration and deceleration, and there is a device on board that measures the rate of closing between the two vehicles. The following strategy has been proposed for bringing the craft to rest. First, look at the\n",
    "closing velocity. If it is zero, we are done. Otherwise, remember the closing velocity and look at the acceleration control. Move the acceleration control so that it is opposite to the closing velocity (i.e., if closing velocity is positive, we slow down, and we speed up if it is negative) and proportional in magnitude (i.e., we brake twice as hard if we find ourselves closing twice as fast). After a time, look at the closing velocity again and repeat the procedure. Under what circumstances will this strategy be effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "(From the textbook):\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $v_n$ denote the closing velocity observed at time $t_n$, the time of the nth observation. Let $\\Delta v_n = v_{n+1} - v_n$ denote the change in closing velocity as a result of our adjustments. The time interval divides into two parts: the time it takes to adjust the velocity controls and the time between adjustments and the next observation of the velocity indicator. Write $\\Delta t_n = c_n + w_n$, where $c_n$ is the time to adjust the controls and $w_n$ is the waiting time until the next observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $a_n$ denote the acceleration setting after the nth adjustment. Elementary physics yields $\\Delta v_n = a_{n-1}c_n + a_n w_n.$ The control law says to set acceleration proportional to $(-v_n)$; hence $a_n = -kv_n$. These results are summarized below.\n",
